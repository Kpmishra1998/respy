    "## The choice rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice rewards are central to define choices in general. First of all, each choice can have two categories of reward parameters which are named `wage_{choice}` and `nonpec_{choice}` in the `category` index level. `wage` and `nonpec` refer to the two components of utility functions for Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin models. In a nutshell, the utility of a working alternative is defined by the sum of a wage and a nonpecuniary component. The nonpecuniary reward $N$ is a vector product of parameters $\\beta^N$ and covariates $x^N$. The wage $W$ is defined as the exponential function of a vector product of parameters $\\beta^W$ and covariates $x^W$ plus a normally distributed shock $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    U = W + N = \\exp\\{x^W\\beta^W + \\epsilon\\} + x^N\\beta^N\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-working alternatives, $W = 0$ and the normally distributed shock is added to the nonpecuniary reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    U = N = x^N\\beta^N + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to the reward groups, `wage_{choice}` and `nonpec_{choice}` contain the parameters $\\beta$ for the vector product of the respective utility component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take a look at the reward parameter for `fishing` and focus on `wage_fishing` first. The group contains a single parameter whose value is 0.1. Now, how is the parameter $\\beta$ multiplied with the correct covariate $x$? This is achieved by the `name` index level of the parameter. In this case, `exp_fishing` is the name of a column in an internal DataFrame which contains the experience in fishing for an individual. After the vector product is computed, a shock which is drawn internally is added to the sum and the value is exponentiated to receive the wage component for the choice `fishing`."
